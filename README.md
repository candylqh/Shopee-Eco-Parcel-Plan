# Shopee-Eco-Parcel-Plan
This project is done as part of Shopee's Product &amp; Design Challenge 2021, with a focus on Product Management & UI/UX Design. Contestants are tasked to propose a solution that focuses on (i) improving an existing feature OR (ii) creating a new feature that would enable Shopee to remain the leading e-commerce platform in your chosen market.

My team and I have proposed a new product feature, namely the Eco Parcel Plan in our efforts to rebrand Shopee as Southeast Asia' leading e-commerce platform championing for sustainable business practices.
