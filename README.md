# Shopee-Eco-Parcel-Plan
This project is done as part of Shopee's Product &amp; Design Challenge 2021, with a focus on Product Management & UI/UX Design. Contestants are tasked to propose a solution that focuses on (i) improving an existing feature OR (ii) creating a new feature that would enable Shopee to remain the leading e-commerce platform in your chosen market.

My team and I have proposed a new product feature, namely the Eco Parcel Plan in our efforts to rebrand Shopee as Southeast Asia' leading e-commerce platform championing for sustainable business practices. 

Feel free to read more about our project from the Slide Deck uploaded within this repository, or head over to our live prototype at https://candylqh.github.io/Shopee-Eco-Parcel-Plan/. The prototype is best viewed on desktop and at full screen (by clicking the arrow icon on the top right).
